# Netatalk for macOS
This is a fork of the 3.1 branch of the Netatalk repo on SourceForge. It has been patched for clean compilation and use on current versions of macOS only, and enables AFP2 file sharing between modern macs and classic macs running Mac OS 9.2.2.  It has been tested on macOS 11 (Big Sur) and 10.14 (Mojave). All code unused in macOS has been removed so this version of Netatalk will only run on modern Intel or Apple Silicon macs.
